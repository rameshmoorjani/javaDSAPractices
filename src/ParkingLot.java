/**
*
* Design a parking lot using object-oriented principles
*
* Goals:
* - Your solution should be in Java - if you would like to use another language, please let the interviewer know.
* - Boilerplate is provided. Feel free to change the code as you see fit
*
* Assumptions:
* - The parking lot can hold motorcycles, cars and vans
* - The parking lot has regular spots
* - A motorcycle can park in one regular spot
* - A car can park in a 2 consecutive regular spot
* - A van can park, but it will take up 3 consecutive regular spots
* - These are just a few assumptions. Feel free to ask your interviewer about more assumptions as needed
*
* Here are a few methods that you should be able to run:
* - Tell us how many spots are remaining
* - Tell us how many total spots are in the parking lot
* - Tell us when the parking lot is full
* - Tell us when the parking lot is empty
* - Tell us when certain spots are full e.g. when all van spots are taken
* - Tell us how many spots vans are taking up
*
* Hey candidate! Welcome to your interview. I'll start off by giving you a Solution class. To run the code at any time, please hit the run button located in the top left corner.
